Summary
    Group records into pipes.

Description
    Argument $1 is the number of fields of each record to use as the key.
    The fields are one based. Default is one.

    Return a record for each unique key discovered in the records read
    from stdin. The retuned records contain as many fields as are present
    in the key plus one for a file descriptor which contains the group 
    members and be drained before the next group record is produced. 
    The file descriptor contians only the fields that follow the key of 
    the grouped record read from stdin.
